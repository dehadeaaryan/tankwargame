## How to Play

Once you're in the game, you control a **Player Tank** and must defeat enemy tanks while avoiding damage.

### Controls

- **W, A, S, D**: Use these keys to move your tank around the game screen.
    - **W**: Move Forward
    - **A**: Move Left
    - **S**: Move Backward
    - **D**: Move Right
- **Space**: Press the **Spacebar** to **fire a missile**.

Your **Player Tank** moves based on the keys you press and fires missiles when the Spacebar is hit. The game also features **Enemy Tanks** that move and fire automatically.

### Game Actions

- **Movement**: Move your tank in all directions using the WASD keys.
- **Firing**: Press **Space** to fire a missile at enemy tanks. A missile is launched in the direction your tank is facing.
- **Health**: Your tank’s health is displayed in the UI. If your health reaches zero, the game is over.
- **MedPacks**: MedPacks will occasionally appear on the screen. If your tank collides with a MedPack, it will heal you.
